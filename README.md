**exxam.io** is a fully responsive **frontend UI design** for an online exam web app.  
It is built completely by **Om Krishna Hankare** using **React**, **JSX**, **HTML**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

This project is a **self-made, custom recreation** inspired by the original **exxam.io** website.  
I created this UI from scratch as a practice/design showcase.  
It demonstrates how I can build clean, modern, responsive layouts **without any pre-made UI libraries**.

A PNG screenshot (`exxam.io UI.png`) is attached so you can see exactly **what the real exxam.io looks like** and **what I recreated** using only code.
